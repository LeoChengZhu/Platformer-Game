# My Personal Project

# 2D Platformer Level Creator

## What will the application do?
The application should be able to allow the user to create a blank level that is within a certain size, then to add objects(terrain), a character, a start and end point then to be able to control the character in the created level. The application should also be able to save and load multiple different levels individually. 

## Who will use it?
This application will be for people interested in creating a simple 2D platformer of their own as well as people that are interested in this genre as well.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is interesting to me as I am interested in the process of game creation, and I think the process of creating something that can be used as a simple game creator can tell me a lot more about game creation that is different from just playing the games. Making the project a level creator also makes it so that I have some more freedom in making the application instead of trying to make something fixed.
